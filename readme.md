# User Stories

I skal implementere en to-do liste. I skal gøre det i grupper af 2-3. For hver person i gruppen skal I implementere 2 **user stories**. Der er givet en start main.cpp I kan tage udgangspunkt i.

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to add tasks to my to-do list so that I can keep track of what I need to do.**  
2. **As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed so that I can see what I have accomplished.**  
3. **As a user, I want to view all my tasks so that I can see what needs to be done.**  
4. **As a user, I want to edit existing tasks so that I can update their descriptions or statuses.**  
5. **As a user, I want to delete tasks from my to-do list so that I can remove tasks that are no longer needed.**  
6. **As a user, I want to set due dates for my tasks so that I can manage my time effectively.**  
7. **As a user, I want to prioritize my tasks so that I can focus on the most important ones first.**  
8. **As a user, I want to filter my tasks by their status so that I can easily see which tasks are pending or completed.**  
9. **As a user, I want to sort my tasks by their due dates so that I can see which tasks are due soonest.**  
10. **As a user, I want to search for tasks by keyword so that I can quickly find specific tasks.**
